# Image-Comparison-Slider
An image comparison slider is a graphical user interface element that allows users to compare two images by sliding a handle back and forth over the images to reveal more or less of one image relative to the other. This type of UI element is commonly used in websites and mobile applications to showcase before and after images, product comparisons, or other types of image comparisons.
